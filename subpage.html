            Thanks for reading this far. Let me tell you a bit about myself. I moved from my small town Port Alberni to venture into the big city of Calgary which I worked as a hospital unit clerk. I decided to move back home to Port which had me looking for a new career. I choose Website Design and Development because I like to be creative; I also remember my first computer and entering code to play a game of stick hangman, which fascinated me.
