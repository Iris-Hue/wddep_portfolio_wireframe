        <h4>Mobile-First</h4>

        <h4>Online Registration Form</h4>
        <p class="card-parag"> Here is a simple web form for users to fill out to collect information.
            I used HTML elements to create labels to help the user fill the form out correctly.
            Some of the form fields used were: text input, checkboxes and a select menu that pops down.</p>

        <h4>Gameshow App</h4>
        <p class="card-parag">An interactive word guessing game.
            Building this app is where I learned JavaScript.
            I had to create a JS function that randomly chooses a letter from the phase word.</p>

        <h4>Employee Directory</h4>
        <p class="card-parag">I created this page to have all the employees' contact information along with their photos.
            This project used API(Application Programming Interface) usage and fetch to select the employee from the list.
            Then created a JS modal window that displays the employees' contact details.</p>

        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p class="bio-parag">
            Thanks for reading this far. Let me tell you a bit about myself. I moved from my small town Port Alberni to venture into the big city of Calgary which I worked as a hospital unit clerk. I decided to move back home to Port which had me looking for a new career. I choose Website Design and Development because I like to be creative; I also remember my first computer and entering code to play a game of stick hangman, which fascinated me.
